# About the dataset

All our experiments are conducted on the real-world IP traces collected by CAIDA in 2019. Here, we provide a small sample of the full dataset for your testing. The full dataset can be obtained by requesting it fromÂ [CAIDA Catalog Details - Anonymized Internet Traces 2019](https://catalog.caida.org/dataset/passive_2019_pcap). In this sample data, each packet is identified by a source address and a destination address.
