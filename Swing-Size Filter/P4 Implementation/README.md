# P4 Implementation of Swing-Size Filter

This folder contains the source code for P4 implementation of Swing-Size Filter.

## Description

We implement Swing-Size Filter using the P4_16 language, targeting programmable hardware switches. Our implementation is compatible with:

- BMv2 (Behavioral Model v2) — a software switch for functional testing and validation.
- Barefoot Tofino programmable switches — high-performance programmable switches based on the Tofino ASIC.
